# Football Tactics AI (2025 Edition)

What if football broadcasting came with tactical overlays, live player tracking, and AI coaching commentaryâ€”automatically?

This is a modern AI-powered project that analyzes football game clips to:
- Detect players and ball using YOLOv8
- Track spatial positions across time
- Map team formations and ball paths
- Generate tactical insights using GPT-4

Built with:
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- Streamlit
- OpenAI GPT-4o
- Roboflow (dataset support)
- Google Colab for fast GPU prototyping

Goal: Ship a working MVP by August 22, 2025 to showcase in my Perplexity APM portfolio.
